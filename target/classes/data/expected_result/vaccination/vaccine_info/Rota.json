Information</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p style=\"padding-left: 15px\">\r\n\t\t<strong>Rotavirus </strong>is a virus that spreads easily among infants and young children. The virus can cause severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain. Children who get rotavirus disease can become dehydrated and may need to be hospitalized.<br />\r\n\t\tRotavirus vaccine is the best way to protect your child against rotavirus illness. Most children (about 9 out of 10) who get the vaccine will be protected from severe rotavirus illness. While about 7 out of 10 children will be protected from rotavirus illness.<br />\r\n\t\tTwo rotavirus vaccines are currently licensed for use in infants in the United States:<br />\r\n\t\tRotaTeq® (RV5) is given in 3 doses at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months<br />\r\n\t\tRotarix® (RV1) is given in 2 doses at ages 2 months and 4 months<br />\r\n\t\tBoth vaccines are given by mouth (orally), not by a shot. The first dose of either vaccine is most effective if it is given before a child is 15 weeks of age. Also, children should receive all doses of rotavirus vaccine before they turn 8 months old.<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease spread by: </strong>Through the mouth<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease symptoms: </strong>Diarrhea, fever, vomiting<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease complications: </strong>Severe diarrhea, dehydration.<br />\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p><strong>2. Preventive measures</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<div style=\"padding-left: 15px\">\r\n\t\tRotavirus (RV) vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for both RV1 [Rotarix] and RV5 [RotaTeq])<br />\r\n\t\tRoutine vaccination:<br />\r\n\t\tAdminister a series of RV vaccine to all infants as follows:<br />\r\n\t\t<ol style=\"margin: 0\">\r\n\t\t\t<li>If Rotarix is used, administer a 2-dose series at ages 2 and 4 months.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>If RotaTeq is used, administer a 3-dose series at ages 2, 4, and 6 months.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>If any dose in the series was RotaTeq or vaccine product is unknown for any dose in the series, a total of 3 doses of RV vaccine should be administered.</li>\r\n\t\t</ol>\r\n\t\tCatch-up vaccination:<br />\r\n\t\t<ul style=\"margin: 0\">\r\n\t\t\t<li>The maximum age for the first dose in the series is 14 weeks, 6 days; vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged 15 weeks, 0 days, or older.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>The maximum age for the final dose in the series is 8 months, 0 days.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>"
