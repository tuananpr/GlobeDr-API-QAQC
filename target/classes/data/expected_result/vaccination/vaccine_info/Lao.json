Tuberculosis usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, kidneys, or spinal column. People with TB can die if they are not treated promptly.<br /> Disease spread by: Tuberculosis viruses are introduced into the air when a person has tuberculosis or cough, sneezing, speech or singing. These germs can stay in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. People breathing in air containing TB virus may be infected; This is called latent TB infection.<br /> <strong>Disease symptoms:</strong> Common symptoms of TB include feeling sick or depressed, losing weight, fever and night sweats. Tuberculosis symptoms also include cough, chest pain, and coughing up blood. TB symptoms in other parts of the body depend on the affected area.<br /> <strong>TB Prevention:</strong> The illness can be treated by taking certain medications for 6 to 12 months. It is very important for people with TB to complete the medication, and take the medication as prescribed. If they stop taking it too soon, they may get sick again; If they do not take the medicine correctly, the virus is still alive and can become resistant. TB resistance will be harder and more expensive to treat. At present, Vietnam has the first vaccination against tuberculosis.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif; \"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif;\">2.
