Information</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p style=\"padding-left: 15px\">\r\n\t\t<strong>Hepatitis A </strong>is an infection in the liver caused by hepatitis A virus. The virus is spread primarily person-to-person through the fecal-oral route. In other words, the virus is taken in by mouth from contact with objects, food, or drinks contaminated by the feces (stool) of an infected person. Symptoms can include fever, tiredness, poor appetite, vomiting, stomach pain, and sometimes jaundice (when skin and eyes turn yellow). An infected person may have no symptoms, may have mild illness for a week or two, may have severe illness for several months, or may rarely develop liver failure and die from the infection. In the U.S., about 100 people a year die from hepatitis A.<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease spread by: </strong>Direct contact, contaminated food or water<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease symptoms: </strong>May be no symptoms, fever, stomach pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, vomiting, jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), dark urine<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease complications: </strong> Liver failure, arthralgia (joint pain), kidney, pancreatic, and blood disorders.<br />\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p><strong>2.
