Information</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p style=\"padding-left: 15px\">\r\n\t\t<strong>Pneumonia </strong>is an infection of the lungs that can be caused by the bacteria called pneumococcus. This bacteria can cause other types of infections too, such as ear infections, sinus infections, meningitis (infection of the covering around the brain and spinal cord), and bacteremia (bloodstream infection). Sinus and ear infections are usually mild and are much more common than the more serious forms of pneumococcal disease. However, in some cases pneumococcal disease can be fatal or result in long-term problems, like brain damage and hearing loss. Pneumococcal disease spreads when people cough or sneeze. Many people have the bacteria in their nose or throat at one time or another without being illâ€”this is known as being a carrier.<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease spread by: </strong>Air, direct contact<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease symptoms: </strong>May be no symptoms, pneumonia (infection in the lungs)<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease complications: </strong> Bacteremia (blood infection), meningitis (infection of the covering around the brain and spinal cord), death.<br />\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p><strong>2.
