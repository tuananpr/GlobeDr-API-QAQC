Pertussis<br /> </span></strong></p><p style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif;margin: 0in 0in 10px .25in;\">Pertussis is caused by bacteria spread through direct contact with respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In the beginning, symptoms of pertussis are similar to the common cold, including runny nose, sneezing, and cough. After 1-2 weeks, pertussis can cause spells of violent coughing and choking, making it hard to breathe, drink, or eat. This cough can last for weeks. Pertussis is most serious for babies, who can get pneumonia, have seizures, become brain damaged, or even die. About half of children under 1 year of age who get pertussis must be hospitalized.<br /> Disease spread by: Air, direct contact<br /> Disease symptoms: Severe cough, runny nose, apnea (a pause in breathing in infants)<br /> Disease complications: Pneumonia (infection in the lungs), death.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif;\"></span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif\"><strong>b. Diphtheria</strong> <br /> </span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10px .25in;\">Diphtheria is a very contagious bacterial disease that affects the respiratory system, including the lungs. Diphtheria bacteria can be passed from person to person by direct contact with droplets from an infected person&rsquo;s cough or sneeze. When people are infected, the bacteria can produce a toxin (poison) in the body that can cause a thick coating in the back of the nose or throat that makes it hard to breathe or swallow. Effects from this toxin can also lead to swelling of the heart muscle and, in some cases, heart failure. In serious cases, the illness can cause coma, paralysis, and even death.<br /> Disease spread by: Air, direct contact<br /> Disease symptoms: Sore throat, mild fever, weakness, swollen glands in neck<br /> Disease complications: Swelling of the heart muscle, heart failure, coma, paralysis, death</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif;\"></span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif\"><strong>c. Tetanus</strong><br /></span></p><p  style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10px .25in;\">Tetanus is caused by bacteria found in soil, dust, and manure. The bacteria enters the body through a puncture, cut, or sore on the skin. When people are infected, the bacteria produce a toxin (poison) that causes muscles to become tight, which is very painful. Tetanus mainly affects the neck and belly. This can lead to &ldquo;locking&rdquo; of the jaw so a person cannot open his or her mouth, swallow, or breathe. Complete recovery from tetanus can take months. One to two out of 10 people people who get tetanus die from the disease.<br /> Disease spread by: Exposure through cuts in skin<br /> Disease symptoms: Stiffness in neck and abdominal muscles, difficulty swallowing, muscle spasms, fever<br /> Disease complications:Broken bones, breathing difficulty, death.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif;\">2.

Exception: DTaPIPV [Kinrix, Quadracel]: 4 years)</strong><br /> <strong>Routine vaccination:</strong><br /> &bull; Administer a 5-dose series of DTaP vaccine at ages 2, 4, 6, 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years. The fourth dose may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since the third dose.<br /> &bull; Inadvertent administration of fourth DTaP dose early: If the fourth dose of DTaP was administered at least 4 months after the third dose of DTaP and the child was 12 months of age or older, it does not need to be repeated.<br /> <strong>Catch-up vaccination:</strong> The fifth dose of DTaP vaccine is not necessary if the fourth dose was administered at age 4 years or older.</span></p>\r\n</div>"
