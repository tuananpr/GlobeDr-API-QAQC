Information</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p><strong>a. Rubella</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p style=\"padding-left: 15px\">\r\n\t\t<strong>Rubella </strong>is caused by a virus that is spread through coughing and sneezing. In children rubella usually causes a mild illness with fever, swollen glands, and a rash that lasts about 3 days. Rubella rarely causes serious illness or complications in children, but can be very serious to a baby in the womb. If a pregnant woman is infected, the result to the baby can be devastating, including miscarriage, serious heart defects, mental retardation and loss of hearing and eye sight.<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease spread by: </strong>Air, direct contact<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease symptoms: </strong>Children infected with rubella virus sometimes have a rash, fever, swollen lymph nodes<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease complications: </strong>Very serious in pregnant womenâ€”can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, birth defects.<br />\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p><strong>b. Measles</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p style=\"padding-left: 15px\">\r\n\t\t<strong>Measles </strong>is one of the most contagious viral diseases. Measles virus is spread by direct contact with the airborne respiratory droplets of an infected person. Measles is so contagious that just being in the same room after a person who has measles has already left can result in infection. Symptoms usually include a rash, fever, cough, and red, watery eyes. Fever can persist, rash can last for up to a week, and coughing can last about 10 days. Measles can also cause pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, or death.<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease spread by: </strong>Air, direct contact<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease symptoms: </strong>Rash, fever, cough, runny nose, pinkeye<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease complications: </strong>Encephalitis (brain swelling), pneumonia (infection in the lungs), death.<br />\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p><strong>c. Mumps</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p style=\"padding-left: 15px\">\r\n\t\t<strong>Mumps </strong>is an infectious disease caused by the mumps virus, which is spread in the air by a cough or sneeze from an infected person. A child can also get infected with mumps by coming in contact with a contaminated object, like a toy. The mumps virus causes swollen salivary glands under the ears or jaw, fever, muscle aches, tiredness, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. Severe complications for children who get mumps are uncommon, but can include meningitis (infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), permanent hearing loss, or swelling of the testes, which rarely results in decreased fertility.<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease spread by: </strong>Air, direct contact<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease symptoms: </strong>Swollen salivary glands (under the jaw), fever, headache, tiredness, muscle pain<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Disease complications: </strong>Meningitis (infection of the covering around the brain and spinal cord) , encephalitis (brain swelling), inflam\u00ad mation of testicles or ovaries, deafness.<br />\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p><strong>2.

(Minimum age: 12 months for routine vaccination)<br />\r\n\t\tRoutine vaccination:<br />\r\n\t\t<ul style=\"margin: 0\">\r\n\t\t\t<li>Administer a 2-dose series of MMR vaccine at ages 12 through 15 months and 4 through 6 years. The second dose may be administered before age 4 years, provided at least 4 weeks have elapsed since the first dose.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Administer 1 dose of MMR vaccine to infants aged 6 through 11 months before departure from the United States for international travel. These children should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, the first at age 12 through 15 months (12 months if the child remains in an area where disease risk is high), and the second dose at least 4 weeks later.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Administer 2 doses of MMR vaccine to children aged 12 months and older before departure from the United States for international travel.
