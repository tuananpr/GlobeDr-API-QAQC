Information</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p style=\"padding-left: 15px\">\r\n\t\tCholera is an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. An estimated 3-5 million cases and over 100,000 deaths occur each year around the world. The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe. Approximately one in 10 (5-10%) infected persons will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours.<br />\r\n\t\tA person can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium. In an epidemic, the source of the contamination is usually the feces of an infected person that contaminates water and/or food. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water. The disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another; therefore, casual contact with an infected person is not a risk for becoming ill.<br />\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p><strong>2. Preventive measures</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<div style=\"padding-left: 15px\">\r\n\t\tThe FDA recently approved a single-dose live oral cholera vaccine called Vaxchora (lyophilized CVD 103-HgR) for adults 18 – 64 years old who are traveling to an area of active cholera transmission with toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 (the bacteria strain that most commonly causes cholera). The vaccine is not routinely recommended for most travelers from the United States, as most people do not visit areas of active cholera transmission. Two other oral inactivated, or non-live cholera vaccines, Dukoral® and ShanChol®, are World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified, but these vaccines are not available in the U.S. No cholera vaccine is 100% protective and vaccination against cholera is not a substitute for standard prevention and control measures.<br />\r\n\t\tFor more information, please visit the Vaccines page.<br />\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>"
